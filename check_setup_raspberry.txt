#setup raspberry to handle DAC modulo
# ensure DAC supply is less than 5v, i, if   it is higher it's posible that the I2c chanel does not recognize the device
#you can find more information in https://wiki.dfrobot.com/Gravity__12-Bit_I2C_DAC_Module_SKU__DFR0552
#set up:
sudo raspi-config
#Then use the up and down keys to select “3 Interfacing Options” -> “P5 I2C” and press Enter to confirm “YES”. Reboot the Raspberry Pi. 
# install python libraries
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install build-essential python-dev python-smbus git
#go to proyect directory
#not forget activate python virtual enviroment if you are working with one
# 
git clone https://github.com/DFRobot/DFRobot_MCP4725.git
cd DFRobot_MCP4725/RaspberryPi/python
# if you are working in virtual  enviroment you must type
sudo $(which python)  DFRobot_MCP4725.py # This is necesary to run file .py whit the python virtual enviroment
# if you are not woring in virtul enviroment just type
sudo python DFRobot_MCP4725.py
